1. Final Project and paper on Stable Marriage Problem.
In our paper and project, we look at the current headway and more real life applications of the Gale Shapley stable marriage problem. In precise, we concentrate on the case of Hospital Intern matching problem. We study the correlation between the stable marriage problem and matching and try to infer graph theoretic principles that inspire the approaches and methodologies used to solve these real life scenarios. We implement Gale Shapley based greedy method for optimal stable marriage solution in the initial preference list. We also generate the results and special cases after the simulation and study. We also document a few difficulties and hurdles encountered throughout the project. /n
2. Programming assingment problems and solution.
